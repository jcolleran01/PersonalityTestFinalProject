# PersonalityTestFinalProject
I am going to create an personality test app similar to a buzzfeed quiz. The app will ask a certain number of question and each question will go towards a 
category of topic. The test is to determine what kind of superhero you are. It would ask a question like "Which role would yourchoose in a play" 
A) Actor B) Stage crew. That question would help determine what superhero you are based on whether you want to have your identity secret or not
(A is more like the iron man and B is more like batman). It would also ask questions like
"If you could only save one would you save a group of a 1000 civileans or a group of you five closest friends, who would you save?" A) civilians 8) Closest friends.
This would determine your selflessness and through a series of questions it would determine which superhero you are closest related to. 
At the end it will tell you which hero you are. I created four categories of questions that each have two questions in them. 
Based on the majority of questions you pick per category it will lean you to one attribute. Based on which attributes you are leaning towards will determine your hero.
If you dont know which way you lean towards there is a I dont know answer. This will neglect the question and go based off all the other results. 
It will say fun responses based on the answer you pick and should be a fun way to determine your hero side (:

-- My program contains various buttons to help drive user input
-Activity Life Cycle
-- the program will utilize the onCreate function to initialize my test
-Model View Controller
-- The program will utilize the MVC design pattern to minimize how much output the user needs to read
-Toast
-- My program will use toasts to communicate with the user 
-Intent
